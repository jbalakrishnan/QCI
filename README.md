Sage code and data for 

"Quadratic Chabauty and rational points I: $p$-adic heights" (Jennifer S. Balakrishnan and Netan Dogra)

For code to carry out Example 1 (Section 8.3), the main file is Ex1.sage. 
To run it, replace the following Sage library files with the files in this repository and rebuild Sage:
 * src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padics.py
 * src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_generic.py
 * src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_padic_field.py

For the data produced in Example 2 (Section 8.4), the tables of p-adic points are available in
 * data/tables.txt
 * data/tables.pdf
